Grid code breaks on GCC4.8, 4.9, 5.0 due to the 
peekIndex<n> operating on lattice.

It erroneously recurses back into the Lattice<obj> variant, even though
the lattice container is dropped.

Work around is possible; if the Lattice routine is given a disambiguating 
name prefix, such as 

latPeekIndex<n> 

GCC5 works. 

However this is ugly and for now I have submitted a bug report to see the reaction and
speed of fixing. 

The simple testcase in this directory is the submitted bug report that encapsulates the
problem. The test case works with icpc and with clang++, but fails consistently on g++
current variants.

Second GCC bug reported, see Issue 100.

Getting Travis fails under gcc-5 for Test_simd, now that I added more comprehensive testing to the
CI test suite. The limitations of Travis runtime limits & weak cores are being shown.

Travis uses 5.4.1 for g++-5.
